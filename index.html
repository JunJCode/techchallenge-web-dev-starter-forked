    About The Kingdom
    </h2>
    <p>
    The Mushroom Kingdom is a principality ruled by Princess Peach as head of state. In the instruction manual of Super Mario Bros. (1985), Peach debuts as the princess of the kingdom. Toadsworth is her steward. A minority of humans like Princess Peach, Mario, and Luigi live in the kingdom. It is mostly populated by Toad citizens. There are colonies of Yoshis, Goombas, and Koopas. Other creatures in Peach's territory include Boos. The kingdom's most famous currency is various colors of coins. Dispersed across the land are brown brick blocks and golden "question-mark blocks", which may contain coins or power-ups. The main mode of transportation in the Mushroom Kingdom is warp pipes. Some pipes merely travel a short distance (such as over and underground), while some pipes are linked to entirely different worlds. New warp tools and areas have been introduced in games since including the secret "warp whistle" in Super Mario Bros. 3 and cannons in New Super Mario Bros..
